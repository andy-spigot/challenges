# Challenges

The Bukkit/Spigot plugin that lets you configure over 400 different challenges for your players to complete!

## Your configuration files are incompatible with this version of Challenges!

If you're receiving this message when you enable Challenges on your server, you have a couple of options. 

**IF LOSING YOUR CURRENT CHALLENGES AND PLAYER PROGRESSION IS NOT AN ISSUE**, you can delete the folder named "Challenges" from your server's plugins directory. The next time you enable the plugin, it will generate the default files for Challenges 3. Do consider that these files are only intended as examples to refer to when configuring your own challenges, so they might not be appropriate for a public server.

Otherwise, it is recommended that you return to your previous version of Challenges. Challenges 2 will continue to receive bug fixes only, however this may be discontinued at any time. Don't forget that you can always update to Challenges 3 if your server is resetting or you just want some refreshed challenges!
